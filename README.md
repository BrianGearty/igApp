# Thoughts

### If I had more time I would have created a reset button that would have cleared the whole page and started fresh. I also would have cleared the form every time you click "Add To Cart" button. I would have added validations to the form inputs as well as tests. I thought of handling this with just the hard-coded data given in the Github Gist but wanted to be able to add other items outside of the test data too.

### * I assumed that anything with "imported" in the name of the product would always be checked "Yes" for Imported on the form. I would have liked to figure out a better way to determine whether imported or not but with the data given that is what I went with.
